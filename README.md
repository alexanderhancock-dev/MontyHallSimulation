This is a simulation of the [Monty Hall Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem), a probability puzzle with a counter-intuitive answer.

After compiling, run it on the command line with the number of times you want the simulation to run as an argument.<br>
e.g. ```MontyHall.exe 20``` or ```./MontyHall 20```
